# dom0-utils
a collection of convenience scripts for Qubes, mostly intended to be run from dom0. 

Disclaimer: Dom0 isn't really meant to be tampered with all that much.
Some of these scripts are specifically for making tampering easier.
Use wisely. If you wreck your once iron-clad opsec by using these
scripts, you'll have only yourself to blame.
